					<h1>Silver</h1>
					<div></div>
					<p>Your village is overrun with Werewolves. Tourism is the lifeblood of your usually quiet new England burg, so you'll need to eliminate them quickly. Your neighboring villages are doing the same, however, so now it's a race to see which village can get rid of Werewolves the fastest. Silver is a fast, engaging card game that you can learn in minutes. Use your residents' Special abilities and activate your secret weapon... Silver. When you think you have reduced The Werewolf population more than your neighbors, call for a vote; the player with the fewest Werewolves wins!</p>

					<h2>Trajan</h2>
					<div></div>
					<p>Trajan is a game where almost every action is a positive one, working towards increasing your victory points. Actions are selected using a mancala system that also determines how quickly or slowly each round will go. There are 6 unique actions that operate on different spaces of the shared game board which will allow the players a wide variety of things to do on their turn. Someone described it as a large game with many mini-games, it's an interesting perspective and one that I don't disagree with.</p>
